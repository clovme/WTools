Scripts in the samples folder can be overwritten when JEB updates. If a user-modification is detected,
the updater will rename the modified script to NAME.py.bak.

However, users are recommended to:
- create their scripts in the top-level scripts/ folder (or any custom folder therein)
- if needing to customize a sample script, fork it outside the samples/ folder and work on the copy
