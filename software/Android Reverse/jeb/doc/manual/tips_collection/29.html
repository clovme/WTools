<h2>Tip of the Day #29 - Register your Copy</h2>
<p>If you want to receive individual software update emails, make sure to register your software. The only piece of information we'll be storing is an email address. See the Help menu, Register command. (If your licensed build is an indivudual build, e.g. JEB Pro single-user, you may not need to register since you will be receiving email updates automatically.)</p>
