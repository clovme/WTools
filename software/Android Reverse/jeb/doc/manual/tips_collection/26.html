<h2>Tip of the Day #26 - Scripting in Python</h2>
<p>The JEB API is a comprehensive application programming interface used by JEB clients (including the main GUI program) to communicate with the back-end. Power-users can write JEB extensions that make use of the API to script tasks, have custom plugins, etc. <p>To get accustomed to the API, it is best to start writing Python script (2.7 syntax) doing relatively simple things. JEB ships with many samples, located in the scripts/samples/ folder. Bring up the Scripts selector dialog with F2. You can execute, create, or edit existing scripts. <p>In the example below, the UI API is used to create a custom graph object showing relationship between various code items in a code object.</p>
