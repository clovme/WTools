<h2>Tip of the Day #18 - Method and Fields Overrides</h2>
<p>When on a method object, use the Action, <em>Overrides</em> command to check the implementations in sub-classes, as well as parent implementations in super types. The command also works for fields to see overrides (by name) in sub-classes.</p>
