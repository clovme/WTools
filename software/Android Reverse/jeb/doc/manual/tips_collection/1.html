<h2>Tip of the Day #1 - Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome! If this is your first run, you should be presented with an empty JEB workspace. Create a new project by opening a file (menu File, command <em>Open</em>) to be analyzed: it can be a PE file, an ELF file, an APK or DEX file, or anything else that your JEB build has plugin support for.<p>After an initial analysis pass, your main workspace will display an interactive disassembly listing, as well as a Project tree and a Code Hierarchy tree. You may navigate and modify your analysis via the Actions menu. If you are looking to decompile code, position yourself somewhere in the disassembly and hit the TAB key.</p>
