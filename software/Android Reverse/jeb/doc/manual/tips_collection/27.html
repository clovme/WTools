<h2>Tip of the Day #27 - Writing extensions in Java</h2>
<p>The JEB API is a comprehensive application programming interface used by JEB clients (including the main GUI program) to communicate with the back-end. Power-users can write JEB extensions that make use of the API to script tasks, have custom plugins, etc. <p>Unlike JEB Python scripts (see the previous tip), extensions written in Java can be loaded as full JEB plugins, that will live alongside other JEB plugins for as long as needed. Our GitHub repository provides several open-source plugins, such as a diem VM (move) decompiler or PDF parser.</p>
