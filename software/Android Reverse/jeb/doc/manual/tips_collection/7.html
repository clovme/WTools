<h2>Tip of the Day #7 - Units and Documents</h2>
<p>In JEB, the analysis of an artifact (typically, an input file) yields objects called "units". An artifact usually produces a tree of several units, including code units. Units can be rendered as documents, including text buffers, tables and trees. A code unit will generate a Disassembly document, among many other documents.</p>
