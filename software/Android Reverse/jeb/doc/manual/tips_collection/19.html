<h2>Tip of the Day #19 - Organize your Code</h2>
<p>JEB supports packages and namespaces. Create packages, move code objects (methods, classes, etc.) to them by drag-and-dropping inside the Code Hierarchy panel, or use the Action menu, <em>Create a Package / Move to a Package</em> commands. <p>This command, like all actions located in the Actions menu, is available for native code as well as dex code.</p>
