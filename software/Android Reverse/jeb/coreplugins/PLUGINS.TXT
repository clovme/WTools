JEB Decompiler (c) PNF Software, Inc. 
https://www.pnfsoftware.com

This directory contains JEB external back-end plugins. (They are not to be confused with JEB client scripts.)

Currently, there are three ways to write back-end plugins:

1-  Format:     Jar files.
    Types:      All back-end plugins may be bundled as pre-compiled jar files.
    Capability: May contain any number of classfiles; ideal for complex/mature/stable plugins.
    Language:   Any language compiling to Java classfiles and jar files (Java, Kotlin, etc.).
    Extension:  .jar
    Location:   This folder (typically, coreplugins/).
    Enabled:    Yes, always.
    Hot reload: No (modifications are not supported while JEB is running; a restart is required).

2-  Format:     Java scripts (limited to some plugin types, see below).
    Types:      Currently limited to dexdec IR plugins.
    Capability: Single Java file plugin; ideal for prototyping/moderately complex plugins.
    Language:   Java, matching the JVM executing JEB (e.g. Java 11 syntax if JEB is run using a JVM 11).
    Extension:  .java
    Location:   The plugins' scripts sub-folder (typically, coreplugins/scripts/).
    Enabled:    Yes, always.
    Hot reload: Yes (modifications are supported while JEB is running)

3-  Format:     Python scripts (limited to some plugin types, see below).
    Types:      Currently limited to dexdec IR plugins.
    Capability: Single Python file plugin; ideal for rapid prototyping/simple plugins.
    Language:   Python 2.7, as these plugins will be executed by a Jython 2.7 VM.
    Extension:  .py
    Location:   The plugins' scripts sub-folder (typically, coreplugins/scripts/).
    Enabled:    No by default (add '.LoadPythonPlugins = true' to your JEB's bin/jeb-engines.cfg file)
    Hot reload: Yes (modifications are supported while JEB is running)
